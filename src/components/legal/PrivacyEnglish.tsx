      <h3>General Information and Mandatory Disclosures</h3>
      <h4>Responsible Entity</h4>
      <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
      <p>
        Singularity Digital Ventures GmbH<br />

        The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., name, contact details, etc.).
      </p>
      
      <h4>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h4>
      <p>
        Some data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. Communicating with us, such as writing an email or sending a message via the contact form, is considered explicit consent. You may revoke your consent at any time by sending us an informal email. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Right to File Complaints with Regulatory Authorities</h4>
      <p>
        If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The competent authority is the data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link:<br />

      </p>
      
      <h4>Right to Data Portability</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Right to Access, Rectification, Blocking and Erasure</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right at any time to obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of the data processing. You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked, or deleted, provided that no legal retention requirements exist. For this purpose and for any other questions relating to personal data, you can contact us at any time using the contact details provided in the imprint.
      </p>
      
      <h4>SSL/TLS Encryption</h4>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries you send to us as the website operator, this website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This ensures that the data you transmit cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the lock symbol in your browser's address bar.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Server Log Files</h4>
      <p>
        The website provider automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited on our domain</li>
        <li>Date and time of the server request</li>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is not combined with other data sources. The processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which permits the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for pre-contractual measures.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Contact Form</h4>
      <p>
        The data you enter into the contact form, including your contact details, will be stored in order to process your inquiry or to be available for follow-up questions. This data will not be shared without your explicit consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of this data is based solely on your consent according to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. You give this consent by submitting the contact form. You may revoke this consent at any time with an informal email. The legality of the data processing operations carried out before the revocation remains unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data you entered will remain with us until you request its deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer applies. Mandatory legal provisions—especially retention periods—remain unaffected.
      </p>
